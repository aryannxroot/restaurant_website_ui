# Restaurant Website

This repository contains the code for a sophisticated and elegant restaurant website built using React. It showcases a modern design with a focus on user experience and responsiveness. Feel free to enhance it further as per your needs!

This project was created to improve my React skills and to demonstrate a practical example of a restaurant's digital presence.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
